1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer.

>> data = LOAD 'petrol_dataset' USING PigStorage(',') AS (id:chararray,name:chararray,buyrate:chararray,sellrate:chararray,in:int,out:int,year:int);

>> group_all_volume_out = GROUP data ALL;

>> sum_all_volume_out = FOREACH group_all_volume_out GENERATE SUM(data.out) as totalSoldByAllDistributer;

>> dump sum_all_volume_out;




2. which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol and also display the amount of
petrol sold in volume.

>> ratedata = FOREACH data {
actual_sellrate = (double)SUBSTRING(sellrate,1,(int)SIZE(sellrate));
GENERATE id,name,actual_sellrate as srate,out;
}

>> order_ratedata_by_srate = ORDER ratedata BY srate DESC;

>> limit_top_dist_by_srate = LIMIT order_ratedata_by_srate 10;

>> dump limit_top_dist_by_srate;






3. list 10 year where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

>> group_company = GROUP data BY year;
>> sum_out_of_company = FOREACH group_company GENERATE group, SUM(data.in) as totalYearlyConsumption;
, FLATTEN(data.id);

>> order_sum_company_consumption = ORDER sum_out_of_company BY totalYearlyConsumption DESC;

>> company_top_consumption = LIMIT order_sum_company_consumption 10;

>> dump company_top_consumption;




4. find distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.

>> ratedata = FOREACH data {
actual_sellrate = (double)SUBSTRING(sellrate,1,(int)SIZE(sellrate));
unit_sellrate = actual_sellrate / out;
GENERATE id,name,actual_sellrate as srate,unit_sellrate as usrate,out;
}

>> order_ratedata = ORDER ratedata BY usrate ASC;

>> least_sold_distributer = LIMIT order_ratedata 1;

>> distributer_name = FOREACH least_sold_distributer GENERATE name;

>> dump distributer_name;
